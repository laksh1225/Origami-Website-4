      <h1> Origami Designs </h1>
       <p>
         Origami is derived from two Japanese words: Ori (folded) and Kami (paper).
         Before that, the art was called “orikata” (folded shapes).
         An ancient Japanese legend says if you fold one thousand cranes you will be granted a wish.
